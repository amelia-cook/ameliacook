                my name is amelia !
            </h1>
            at the moment this website is not much, but that's okay. </br>
            progress will be slow, but that doesn't matter. </br>
            i have all the time i need. </br>
            this website will eventually act as a virtual resume </br>
            but for now it is just something to work on. </br>
            there will be somethings about me </br>
            and my education </br>
            some things about my experience </br>
            and my projects. </br>
            but overall this is a personal website </br>
